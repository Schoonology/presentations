# We're Snaking It Live!

The info here is split in two:

- A [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/main/README.md)-based slide deck.
- A [SCRIPT.md](https://github.com/Schoonology/presentations/blob/master/were-snaking-it-live/SCRIPT.md) file with _roughly_ what was _said_ on stage. I go off-script regularly—and there are some extraneous bits—but this will give you the idea.

## Running the slides

At this point it should be as easy as:

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Events

This talk was given at:

- Frontrunners 2023
- CharmCityJS October 2023

Where should I give it next? Send me a line and let me know.
