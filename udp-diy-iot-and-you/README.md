# UDP, DIY, IoT, and You

## Abstract

Why does the Internet of Things seem so foreign to us as web developers? What protocol do my lightbulbs use? Why does it require a $4000 investment?

Learn how to use open standards like Multicast with open hardware like Arduino and familiar languages to integrate with the Things around us.

## Description

The term "Internet of Things" was coined in 1985. It has grown steadily since, with a recent explosion in products from "smart" light bulbs and coffee machines to refrigerators and toothbrushes. Though the popularity of these Things continues to grow, the technologies behind them are controlled by a handful of companies and alliances.

One year later, in 1986, I was born. More importantly, so was IP Multicast. These days, multicast is relegated to large enterprises and IPTV. With a little ingenuity, we can use this technology in the home, building our own IoT devices in the process.

Let's make this even more relevant: attendees will see a live demonstration of these devices using a variety of easily available hardware. Live, running code examples in JavaScript, Ruby, and C++ explore the capabilities of this hardware and other consumer devices.

Who doesn't love an internet-connected popcorn popper?

## Additional Notes

I've been working with multicast and distributed systems for 8 years, and it remains an absolute delight to watch them at work. I'm newer to the hardware world, but the appropriation was straightforward: these devices were made for this kind of mesh networking.

To demo the devices, I will need an extra power outlet (2 total: 1 for the laptop, 1 for the light).
