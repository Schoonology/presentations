# The Intranet of My Things

## Abstract

We are on the cusp of an unprecedented age of corporate control over our daily lives though Internet-enabled Things. Even as web developers, however, we often lack direct access to these same devices in our own homes. Terms like Zigbee, Z-Wave and Lutron may seem foreign to us, but these standards make up the backbone of the Internet of Things. If we call ourselves web developers, why should this "Internet" feel so distant?

Learn how these protocols work, why it matters, and explore what Open Source has to teach the Things.

## Description

As a relatively tech-savvy citizen, I feel I have enough expertise to both be _very_ excited about the growing Internet of Things and _very concerned_ about how that Internet of Things is being built. On one hand, each generation of products brings with it the ingenuity of talented developers. On the other, each generation of protocol brings with it the consolidation of powerful corporations.

If I buy a smart light bulb today, how many network hops does it take to turn the lights on? If someone hacks into the manufacturer's servers, can they turn _off_ my lights? If this seems silly, how about this: can someone attack the light bulb producer and _blink_ all connected lights, inducing seizures in a portion of their users?

With enough education into the protocols and players involved in the fledgling Internet of Things, attendees will be equipped to stand on the front lines of this discussion, armed with an alternative: giving control back to the customer.

## Additional Notes

This is a huge topic: technically, economically, politically, and ethically. I believe you could fill a conference on nothing more than this topic. This talk explores the _surface_ of this concept without the time to dig much deeper than that into the protocols, legalities, intellectual properties, and so forth.

I work with a myriad of clients, including IoT service providers at multiple levels of the stack.
