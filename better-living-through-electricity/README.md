# Better Living Through Electricity

## Abstract

Remote workers make terrible partners: hogging the home coffee machine, saturating the home router, turning your humble sleeping space into a virtual stage for clients a world away.

Find out how a little empathy, a little ingenuity, and a lot of hardware hacking made me a better partner. I created an IoT "on-air" light to tell my family when I'm in a call. No more chuckling on the other end, no more accidental limelight, and no pushing a toddler away live on TV.

Come for the demo, stay for the code.

## Description

No matter how many times I've gotten the "hardware talk", I've always left with the impression that microcontrollers, the Internet of Things, and I just won't get along. There are complicated rules and expensive costs, and I can't afford more of either. After the third time in a row my partner received some "accidental limelight", however, I decided to try anyway. As it turns out, it's gotten cheaper and easier than I could have imaginedâ€”and most of the "rules" haven't kept up.

I built an Internet-connected "on-air" light to automatically tell my family when I'm in a call. No more chuckling on the other end, no more accidental limelight, and no pushing a toddler away live on TV.

Along the way, I did some mythbusting:

- Soldering sucks: Lead and you!
- Breadboards are temporary: There's no more permanent solution...
- Breadboards are immutable: The original "hacking"
- Don't connect LEDs in parallel: Following the "rules"
- This Side Up: Using the wrong parts in the wrong way
- Batteries are best: Someone else's goals

Demonstrations will include the working "On Air" light, working code for the device, and working code integrating the device with a MacBook Pro.

## Additional Notes

To demo the light itself, I'll need an extra power outlet (2 total: 1 for the laptop, 1 for the light). This talk is primarily about entertainment and encouragement, though there is plenty of material to chew on for beginning and experienced developers alike, from firmware and LEDs to `lsof` and `launchd`.
