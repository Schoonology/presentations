# Better Living Through Electricity

## Abstract

Remote workers make terrible partners: hogging the home coffee machine, saturating the home router, and—worst of all—ill-timed video calls, turning your humble sleeping space into a virtual stage for clients a world away.

I may not be able to avoid standup every morning, but I can at least be a better partner through electricity: I created an IoT "on-air" light to tell my family when I'm in a call. I'd never built anything like this before, but it's never been a better time to learn. Walk with me as we do a little learning, a little mythbusting, and a little programming for Better Living...Through Electricity.

## Description

No matter how many times I've gotten the "hardware talk", I've always left with the impression that microcontrollers, the Internet of Things, and I just won't get along. There are complicated rules and expensive costs, and I can't afford more of either. After the third time in a row my partner received "accidental limelight", however, I decided to try anyway. As it turns out, it's gotten cheaper and easier than I could have imagined—and most of the "rules" haven't kept up.

Along with these myths, I'll be exploring the following:

- Soldering sucks: Lead and you!
- Breadboards are temporary: There's no more permanent solution...
- Breadboards are immutable: The original "hacking"
- Don't connect LEDs in parallel: Following the "rules"
- This Side Up: Using the wrong parts in the wrong way
- Batteries are best: Someone else's goals

## Additional Notes

To demo the light itself, I'll need an extra power outlet (2 total: 1 for the laptop, 1 for the light). This talk is primarily about entertainment and encouragement, though there is plenty of material to chew on for beginner IoT developers.
