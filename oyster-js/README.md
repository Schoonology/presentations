# Shuck JavaScript

So... I gave an unconference talk at LibertyJS 2023.

These are the slides, built in [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/main/README.md), but I'm really not sure how useful they are.

## Running the slides

At this point it should be as easy as:

```
npm install
npm start
```
