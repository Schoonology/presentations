# Infinite Possibilities: Procedural Content Generation

## Abstract

With the release of _No Man's Sky_, Procedural Content Generation (PCG) has once again entered the Tech Journalism Lexiconâ„¢. These magicks purport to produce _infinite possibilities_, be they items, levels, characters, dialogue, you-name-it. Let's be practitioners of this magic, and not consumers only, deceiving ourselves as to its nature and its methods.

Let's answer the following questions through the lens of JavaScript:

- What is Procedural Content Generation?
- Classifications of content generators (Not a question, but whatever.)
- What are some common techniques for content generation?
- Are there really infinite worlds in _No Man's Sky_?
- How does it work?
- How can I use PCG on my CRUD-based SPA?

No gaming experience (or even interest) is required, only a general sense of curiosity.
