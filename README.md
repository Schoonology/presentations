# Presentations

A set of talks and the tools that generated them, all sprung out of the recesses of my mind.

## Technology

A new, JavaScript-based presentation framework comes out every week. While [Reveal][reveal] seemed to be king once upon a time, I've lost track of what all the cool kids are using at this point. I've settled with [Spectacle][spectacle] at the moment, but I imagine that'll change at some point, too.
