# JavaScript is (Fundamentally) broken. Stop trying to fix it.

## Abstract

JavaScript is, by design, fundamentally broken. You cannot add a strict type system to JavaScript. You cannot add type _inference_ to JavaScript. You cannot do dead code removal, or branch management, etc. to JavaScript.

You cannot fix JavaScript. To do so would break the World Wide Web as we know it. Async/await will not fix JavaScript. Generators _did not_ fix JavaScript.

We need to focus the considerable scale of JavaScript development toward something better: a language and toolset to _replace_ JavaScript. And no, I'm not talking about Elm.
