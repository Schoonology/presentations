# Beatboxing at my Desk: Software and Music

## Abstract

What does beatboxing possibly have to teach us about software development? Way more than you'd expect:

- How to do the Impossible
- Coaching vs Teaching
- How to Breathe
- Hydration, Hydration, Hydration
- Spittle is Gross, but Inevitable

How much of this can I cover in 10 minutes? We'll see! Come, _learn to beatbox_ (!), and let's get better as developers together.
