## Abstract

Leading a team is hard.

Leading a team remotely is _really_ hard.

Leading a co-located team as the only remote member? Unthinkable.

At least, it should have been. Since I was too naïve to have answered with “impossible” or “no, thank you,” I’ll share the story of how I…managed…it.

## Description

> Why did you have to open your big mouth this time? Managing a team is one thing, but _from across the country?!?_
> 
> You've really done it now: 1 C-level, 1 VP, and 2 Directors, and _you're_ the only talking head on this TV. Okay, all eyes on you, pal—here goes...

Managing a fledgling, co-located team remotely is one of the hardest experiences of my career. Fortunately it's also one of the most gratifying: what started as an innocent Node.js project became an adventure filled with strange solutions and college graduations, mob programming, and contract negotiations.

Please join me in learning from this surreal experience both through technical details such as JSON API and `swagger-tools` to more personal touches like empathy and emigration.

## Additional Notes

As a polyglot software development consultant, I've wound up doing a surprising amount of "change management". My time leading a co-located team remotely remains my most-asked-about engagement over any other, and I've decided to start sharing what I've learned with others.

Whether attendees work remotely or not, this accidental success story has much to teach everyone involved, including me.
