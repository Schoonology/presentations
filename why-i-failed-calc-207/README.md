# Why I Failed Calc 207

## Abstract

Consider this:

- You're not a "real" programmer unless you know how to balance a red-black tree.
- Red-black trees are computer science, not computer programming.
- Computer science is math.
- I failed math.

Does that mean I can't be a "real" programmer? I sure hope not, because now I do math _with computer programs_. In this talk, we'll talk about visibility, math, learning, Monte Carlo, Monty Hall, and our unique ability to better solve‚Äîand better understand‚Äîcomplex mathematical problems with software.

## Description

If I shuffle 12 tiles labelled A through L, what are the odds that G and H will be next to each other? How does that change if I shuffle them into two groups of 6? What about a 4x3 grid? When I posed this question to working mathematicians, statisticians, analytics software developers, and other math lovers, I got a _variety_ of different answers and solutions‚Äîall wrong. No matter what symbolic methods people chose, their symbols failed them.

Instead of relying on any of these answers, I turned to tools I know: software and simulation. Instead of trying to learn a symbolic method, I simulated the exact situation I wanted to predict, and tallied the results. The more I simulated, the better my answer. Was I doing math?

The more I explored this question, the more I found compatible thinking across the board: computer simulation can be simpler to understand and simpler to implement than symbols, (∆í(ùë•) = ‚àë‚à´‚Ä¶) and exploration of these simulations can lead to a deeper understanding of the situation‚Äîand the math.

## Additional Notes

In college, I failed Calculus‚Äî_hard_. By the fifth time I tried to learn what a Taylor series was, I decided to move on. (There may be a reason I only have a BA...)

I have since "moved on" to spend years as a software developer working in the industry, but that shame stuck with me. Starting independent work as a game designer required answers to complicated math problems, returning me to old frustrations. Monte Carlo simulation and stochastic problem solving added a platfulness to math that never existed before‚Äîalong with much-needed math answers.

Also, it's 32% likely that G &amp; H will be next to each other in 2 groups of 6. In case you were wondering.
