# JavaScriptural Exegesis

## Abstract

If we're going to be so dogmatic about JavaScript, why not use the tools of religion to analyze and improve our code?

_Exegesis_ is about analyzing sacred text, so let's use that on JavaScript's own sacred work.

## Description

Consider these questions:

- Which should you use by default: arrow functions, or function expressions?
- When should we use `var`? Should we use `var` at all?
- What is the deal with `Reflect`?

Maybe a better question would be, "When can we stop arguing about JavaScript grammar?" If there's any domain that knows how to argue, it's either religion or philosophy. Fortunately they both agree on a foundational tool for those arguments: a process called "exegesis" (or "hermeneutics", for my philosophers out there).

Let's explore this process of textual criticism and apply it to JavaScript's own sacred text. Along the way we'll not only glean nuance around our grammar, but a way to productively discuss the ever-changing JavaScript language.

## Additional Notes

As long as attendees have a basic understanding of JavaScript, the feature explanations will be accessible to them.

I am a polyglot developer with the honor of being surrounded by other polyglots in my work. JavaScript was not my first language, but my 9th. When it came time to learn JavaScript by writing distributed systems in Node 0.6, it was my experience with the other 8 that provided maturity and nuance, not expertise in JavaScript. Though I may not go through the formality of inductive study every time, the exegetical thought-process inherent to this talk is what I do myself for every new feature, first for my own edification, then for the education of many other JavaScript developers working for my clients and in my community.
