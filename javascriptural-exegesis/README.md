# JavaScriptural Exegesis

## Abstract

If we're going to be so religious about our standards and patterns, why not use religious tools to analyze and improve them?

Exegesis is a tool for nuance and understanding in the absolutes found on bikesheds everywhere, such as "the best function is a const arrow function" and "await is the new Promise".

## Description

If we insist on being religious with our JavaScript, perhaps it's time to use religious tools to improve it—enter _exegesis_.

Do you know where "arrow functions" came from, before they were introduced in ES2015? How about let/const? Or async/await? Better still, what was the "cultural context" of these language features originally, and of their specifications now? Why did the authors of these languages introduce the feature in the first place, and to what audience? These questions and more are wrapped up in this process of textual criticism (or "hermeneutics", for my philosophy nerds out there), and they provide a framework for understanding The Latest JavaScript™ better, making us better as programmers along the way.

This talk is about the process of exegesis, applied to some exciting current and forthcoming features of JavaScript, and the nuance we can glean from those storied origins.

Working code will be presented in both JavaScript and complementary languages (e.g. const in C).

## Additional Notes

As long as attendees have a basic understanding of JavaScript, the feature explanations will be accessible to them.

I am a polyglot developer with the honor of being surrounded by other polyglots in my work. JavaScript was not my first language, but my 9th. When it came time to learn JavaScript by writing distributed systems in Node 0.6, it was my experience with the other 8 that provided maturity and nuance, not expertise in JavaScript. Though I may not go through the formality of inductive study every time, the exegetical thought-process inherent to this talk is what I do myself for every new feature, first for my own edification, then for the education of many other JavaScript developers working for my clients and working in my community.

Technical requirements are nominal.
